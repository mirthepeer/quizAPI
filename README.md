# Quiz App

Welcome to my personal front-end project! This project is a demonstration of my skills as a front-end developer, featuring a responsive quiz application that utilizes a Quiz API. The user can customize their quiz experience by choosing the type of quiz, difficulty level, and topic they want to take. The application is designed to be responsive, so it can be accessed on any device with ease. The user can also see their score at the end of the quiz. I have focused on creating a user-friendly interface and implementing responsive design to make the experience seamless and enjoyable on any device. This project is a front-end only implementation, but it showcases my ability to work with APIs and create a visually pleasing and intuitive user interface. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills, and I welcome any feedback you may have.
